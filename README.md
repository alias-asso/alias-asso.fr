# ALIAS

## What is this?
ALIAS's new website, the CS department's student association at Sorbonne Universit√©, Paris

## What do I do with it?
This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a custom template, a (at the time of writing) rather widespread and popular static website generator, so Markdown in, HTML out. Reading Hugo's documentation is very highly recommended.

**This is currently a work in progress!** Contributions are welcome in any case to the [mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~yopaman/alias-website-devel) after discussion on the [discussion list](https://lists.sr.ht/~chilledfrogs/alias-services-discuss) or [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Qq6u8Mz), and tickets can be filed to [our issue tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~chilledfrogs/alias-services)
