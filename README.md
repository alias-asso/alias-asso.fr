# ALIAS

## What is this?
ALIAS's new website, the CS department's student association at Sorbonne Universit√©, Paris

## What do I do with it?
This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a custom template, a (at the time of writing) rather widespread and popular static website generator, so Markdown in, HTML out. Reading Hugo's documentation is very highly recommended.

**This is currently a work in progress!** Contributions are welcome !
